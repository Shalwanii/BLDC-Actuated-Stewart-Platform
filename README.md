# BLDC-Actuated Stewart Platform for Aerial Additive Manufacturing

This repository contains all **CAD models**, **control code**, and **analysis scripts** developed for the Master's thesis:  
*"Feasibility Study of a Brushless DC Actuated Stewart Platform for Aerial Additive Manufacturing"*.

The project investigates the use of **BLDC motors** in a 6-DOF Stewart platform, aiming to achieve **high responsiveness, precision, and lightweight design** suitable for UAV integration.

## üíª Code

- **Arduino**  
  -   Single-Motor Calibration: Each motor was driven individually under different tolerance thresholds to tune the PD controller and characterise convergence behaviour with potentiometer feedback.  
  - Sequential Motor Testing: Motors were activated one at a time with random target angles while the others were held neutral, measuring settling time, steady-state error, and reachability within defined angle windows.
  - Coordinated Multi-Motor Evaluation: All six motors were commanded simultaneously and achieved poses were compared against desired ones to assess system-level accuracy, convergence, and pose errors.

- **MATLAB**  
  - Scripts for workspace analysis.  
  - Inverse kinematics implementation for rotary Stewart platform.  

- **Python**  
  - Forward Kinematics to obtain Pose from Joint Angles
